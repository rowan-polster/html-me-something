                <h2><em>It was March 19th, 2020, and I was perched beneath an outcrop of 500-million-year-old rock in a glacial relict, deep in the forest.</em></h2>
            <p>Sitting here, watching the sky get darker and darker above the skeletal trees, I was chilled to the bone in a haze of mist. The ancient rock was like ice against my skin. All around me, despite the apparent lack of life, I could feel a sense of anticipation. It was as if the whole forest was collectively holding its breath, waiting for the storm above us to break. For a brief moment, I was a living part of the forest, sharing an experience with the plants, the unseen animals, and whatever else might've been hiding in the mist. The forest was drowned in shadow - the feeling intensified - and suddenly, with a crack of thunder, the rain came cascading down in sheets! The intense feeling washed away, and joy took its place as water came thundering down from the outcrop above me. I sat behind the waterfall as debris crashed into the overflowing stream below. Gradually, the sky lightened. The forest went back to being quiet and wintry again. I felt refreshed and renewed, as I'm sure the forest itself felt after such a downpour. Having gotten what I came here for, I got up and went on my way.</p>
            <p>I don't typically like the word "magic", as its English meaning can be applied to many different things - not all of them related. The word is alienating in its lack of accessibility, its lack of usefulness in "real life". For lack of a better word, this was one of my many encounters with magic, as I see it. That day, I'd witnessed something not unnatural, but definitely otherworldly. This wasn't an accidental scenario, but planned and executed with intention; I'd been feeling stressed, stuck, and claustrophobic lately and I wanted to clear those feelings away, ground myself. For me, the answer was clear: what's more grounding, more life-affirming, than sharing a natural experience with the rest of nature? For a moment, I can shed my human skin and exist wholly absorbed in the mist, the thunderstorm, the ancient rocks, far away from human noise and activity. I can walk away changed, somewhat, by the experience. Empowered. </p>
            <p>Someone else might read this and think, "Gosh, that sounds cold and wet and miserable. I'd much rather do something else."</p>
            <p>But this is the beauty of magic. People are different, so it's only reasonable to assume that different people have different ways of perceiving, and being. Magic, by my definition, is your relationship with the world around you (including yourself). The product of that relationship is greater than the sum of its parts - non-quantifiable, difficult to grasp, but felt in the gut and understood by personal experience alone. </p>
            <p>Margot Adler, an award-winning NPR journalist, describes in her book <em>Drawing Down the Moon</em> her definition of magic after having interviewed a witch at his farm in 1974:</p>
            <p id="quote"><em>"Magic is a convenient word for a whole collection of techniques, all of which involve the mind. In this case, we might conceive of these techniques as including the mobilization of confidence, will, and emotion brought about by the recognition of necessity; the use of imaginative faculties, particularly the ability to visualize, in order to begin to understand how other beings function in nature so we can use this knowledge to achieve necessary ends." </em></p>
            <p>Adler's description sums up my experience pretty well. If I were to break it down systemically, my experience might look like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I recognized a need to be filled (I wanted to be more grounded)</li>
                <li>I planned a way to ground myself using previous experience to guide me (sitting in the woods when I knew no one else would be there)</li>
                <li>I set an intention for myself (grounding and cleansing)</li>
                <li>I prepared mentally beforehand by listening to music that was personally meaningful</li>
                <li>For the duration of my time in the woods, I just sat with nature for as long as I wanted to</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Again, maybe magic isn't always the best word. You could think of my forest excursion as a prolonged meditation, an exercise in mindfulness. The goal was to become the rain, the mist, and the woods for awhile. I came away feeling better than when I arrived.</p>
            <p>You do magic all the time without realizing it. How do you ground yourself after a hard day? When have you had a strong gut feeling that turned out to be correct? What do you do when you want to feel empowered, or how do you pursue success? What do you find beautiful, and how do you try to embody that beauty, surround yourself with it? We all have our little rituals and habits, many done unconsciously, to achieve some kind of equilibrium in our lives. We all perceive the world a little differently, and learn to interact with it based on what works for us and what doesn't. At its core, this is really all magic is.</p>
            <p>If that sounds very ordinary, it should. One of the biggest misconceptions of magic is that it's some kind of supernatural power - somehow above the laws of nature, something that belongs to the world of fantasy. Harry Potter comes to mind, or maybe Lord of the Rings. The magic of Hollywood is flashy, miraculous, and only available to a "chosen one" of sorts. In reality, "magic" as a multicultural worldview is far more down-to-earth and readily applicable. As author Judika Illes puts it, "Magic is as common as dirt."</p>
            <p>But what <em>is</em> magic? In my research, there seem to be two ways of describing magic: Magic as a natural "force", and magic as an "action". A third perspective could be a combination of the two.</p>

                <h2>Magic As Life-Force</h2>
            </header>
            <p>This view seems to be most commonly held by practitioners of "low magic", otherwise known as "folk magic". In this worldview, magic is a natural "force" underlying all of life. Every living thing, including you, radiates this "force". Judika Illes does a beautiful job describing how this view is held across myriad cultures:</p>
            <p id="quote"><em>"There is a power that radiates from all living beings in varying degrees of force and clarity. Different languages have different words to identify this power. The Polynesians refer to it as mana. Among the Yoruba...it is known as ax√©. In Morocco, this power is called baraka and other areas of the Islamic world some variation on that word may be used."</em></p>
            <p>Illes points out that the English language, "demonstrating our cultural ambivalence to magic", lacks a specific word for this concept. In English, we have a single word - magic - which may be used to describe such things as stage tricks, Hollywood special effects, sleight-of-hand. Illes goes on to explain that cultures who embrace the idea of magic tend to have many different words to describe the same thing:</p>
            <p id="quote"><em>"There is no one blanket word to distinguish magic from real life because in these cultures, magic is incorporated into real life. It isn't supernatural but a part of the way natural works."</em></p>
            <p>The best word to describe "magic" in terms of a natural power, in my perspective, is "life-force". In this view, magic is not seperated from reality. It makes itself known by the effect it has on its environment, experienced by you in the form of an emotional response - usually a gut reaction that may be difficult to name or place. You have probably experienced this kind of magic. It manifests in the form of really good music, delicious food, anything that evokes powerful emotions and gut reactions. Meditate on the list below and listen to how your gut responds when you visualize each concept:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An ancient, dimly-lit cathedral vs. a sterile, modern office building</il>
                <li>A home-cooked meal made by someone you love vs. fast food</li>
                <li>A huge, green, lush plant vs. a plastic one</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you're particularly good at visualization, you probably noticed that each concept felt differently in your gut. If not, that's fine too - you've felt it sometime, somewhere, or with someone. This feeling is empowering, enlivening, and ultimately makes you feel good (or at the very least, at home). There's an infectuous sense to it, as if being in the presence of something that radiates this energy is sharing it with you. This is the "life-force" magic described by some practitioners of magic.</p>
            <div class="container2">
                <img class="iveron" src="images/Iveron.jpg">
                <div class="overlay">The "Our Lady of Iveron" icon from Mount Athos, Greece is believed to be "wonderworking" (i.e., miracle-working) by Orthodox Christians</div>
                </div>
            <p>In this vein, the forest I sat in on March 19th was full of "life-force" energy, which responded collectively to the life-giving rain and stimulating lightning. My gut was able to pick up on this collective response. The rainwater I collected and brought home to spray around my apartment contained this "life-force" energy, filling my apartment with it. </p>
            <p>This idea is present in many world religions as well. In Orthodox Christianity, for example, icons depicting saints, angels, and other Biblical figures are seen as more than just simple portraits; they are believed to possess huge amounts of this "life-force energy" (although in Christian terminology, they wouldn't use those words). The allegedly miracle-working icons of the Virgin Mary are especially valued, as are the relics of saints. Other examples of this line of thinking include burning herbs, like sage, for their cleansing properties; holding crystals to absorb their energy; surrounding your personal space with decor that you like to make you feel more at home; and baking cookies for someone you like rather than just buying them at the store. Those cookies share some of your life-force. Giving them to someone is an act of sharing yourself. In fact, you don't have to look too hard to find this concept of magic in many different cultures, spiritual traditions, and even music.</p>

                    </div>
                <h2>Magic As Action</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The other view of magic is as an action, rather than a naturally-occurring life-force. This view tends to be held by practitioners of "high magic", also known as "ceremonial magic" and "Western occultism". Chaos magic falls into this category. The idea here is that magic is something that you DO, a state of mind that you enter. This magic operates on Jungian ideas of a collective unconscious, archetypes, and the symbolic power of ritual. It's psychological in nature, emotional rather than logical, yet there is a scientific emphasis on trial-and-error - using what has proven useful to you personally, and discaring whatever hasn't.</p>
            <p>Whereas "magic as life-force" seems to be the norm across many cultures, the idea of magic as an action seems to be distinctly Western - though the idea is influenced by Eastern philosophy. The idea seems to have been popularized by infamous occultist Aleister Crowley, whose words have shaped modern Western occultism as it's practiced today:</p>
            <p id="quote"><em>"Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with the Will."</em></p>
            <p>Aidan Wachter, author and well-known practitioner of chaos magic, defines magic this way:</p>
            <p id="quote"><em>"Magic and sorcery are ways of being in the world...The aim of magic as I know it is to increase the quantity and quality of usable and useful information, communication, options, and avenues of change and movement within our selves and our worlds. It is an art of total responsibility, careful attention, and reciprocity."</em></p>
            <p>This definition of magic is startlingly average. Notice how he and Crowley refer to magic as an ART - this is a pretty widely-accepted viewpoint among practitioners of magic. A practitioner of magic is really no different from any other artist in that she uses creativity, imagination, and innovation to create the kind of art she wants. Her medium is her daily, mundane life - how can she improve her living situation? Empower her sense of self? Get the job she really wants? Find her soulmate? Nothing is off the table. She may or may not use the "traditional" tools of magic, like a wand or a cauldron. These things don't matter. What matters is what speaks to HER, what inspires her personally. One person's deeply-moving meditation might be kundalini yoga and mantra-chanting; another person's is in the kitchen, cooking an engaging and rewarding recipe. In Aidan Wachter's words, "What works, works. That which does not work...should be discarded or modified until the balance skews more favorably."</p>
            <p>This is chaos magic - using whatever symbols, practices, and rituals work for you personally, regardless of "belief". Many practitioners of this kind of magic are atheist for this reason - magic has no inherent dogma or belief system. It certainly can be incorporated into a spiritual ideology, but it operates just fine without. "Belief" is just another tool that can be used, and its importance is determined only by how it's expressed.</p>
            <div class="container2">
                <img class="meditation" src="images/Meditation-can-improve-mental-health-1.jpg">
                <div class="overlay">The "magic as action" viewpoint is very cerebral. It requires deep, ongoing exploration of the Self through means such as meditation, therapy, and personal responsibility. In this view, magic is "made up" by the conscious mind, but that doesn't diminish its usefulness or power.</div>
                </div>
            <p>In this vein, my experience in the forest on March 19th was the product of my own intention rather than objective reality. It was the <em>action</em> of setting an intention and ritualistically following it through that produced a healing effect. My relationship to the concept of rain, the forest, and nature itself was significant to me, whereas someone else without these affinities may not have gotten much from it. By knowing this about myself, and ritualizing it in a way that felt meaningful, I was practicing magic.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Though it can be tempting to split the world in two, it's more reasonable to assume that there's a third option when considering magic - or an infinite number of options.</p>
            <p>Maybe the "magic as life-force" view is valid, and we ARE capable of working, connecting, and communicating with this "force" on some primal level. Maybe the "magic as action" view is also valid, and that our ability to work, connect, and communicate with this "life-force" is wholly dependent on our individual efforts of self-mastery and introspection. Either way, both viewpoints rely on re-acquainting yourself with your gut instincts and learning how to listen to them effectively. Aidan Wachter refers to this as "gut and bone" feeling which is an integral part of magic.</p>
            <p>Many modern practitioners of magic seem to share the idea that magic is simply science that we don't understand yet. If this is true, then it's only through learned experience, trial-and-error, and endless experimentation that we will find our own individual answers rather than relying on dogma and blind belief.</p>
